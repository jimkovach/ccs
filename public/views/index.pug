        li CaaG - Conference at a Glance - this is a good starting off place.
        ul
          li selecting an event will take you to that events update page
          li selecting a blank cell will take you to the 'New Event' page with building, room, date, and start time already filled in

        li Development is a dropdown of stuff just used in development - not for production.
    p= "The following buttons appear on various single event and update pages..."
      ul
        li Submit: to submit the data just added or updated
        li Cancel: well duh!
        li New: add a new item
        li Update: takes you to the update page where you can change data stored for an event/exhibit/sponsor etc
        li Delete: removes the current event from the database. WARNING: there is no warning or second chance yet. If you click this button, the event is gone
        li Program: Takes you to a program view of that event, how the event will layout in the program
        li note: you will often see a 'checked' reference that is labeled as 'false' - not yet implemented but is there for future updates where you can select individual events for block treatment (deleting, updating in mass, etc.)
    p= "List pages (list, performers, presenters, exhibits, exhibitors, etc.) have the following behavior..."
      ul
        li Clicking the Details icon will take you to the detail page for that event.
        li Clicking on a table header item will usually sort by that item
        li Clicking on an event/exhibit title will take you to that event's/exhibit's update page
        li Clicking on an item in the table (except for the title) will usually display just the entries that contain that item. For instance, in the List, clicking on a category will show all entries in that particular category - try it, you'll see what I mean
        li Clicking on the Trashcan will delete that item from the database. WARNING - there is no undo for this!
    p= "A note on CONFLICTS"
      ul
        li Conflicts are not automatically generated. I feel that as the conference is being built conflicts will naturally occur until we have the final product. Once the product is built conflicts should be checked and dealt with.
        li Besides the CONFLICT menu items, one way to tell if there is a conflict with the events is to go to the CaaG (Conference at a Glance) menus. If a row extends beyond the table, that is a sure sign that there are duplicate events assigned to the same room at that time.
        li I have not developed conflicts for instruments. It seems that instruments may be passed around from site to site. If this is not the case then that functionality can be included.
